And not only for their products, but also for the certifications they offer. If you\u2019re new to tech, you might be wondering: Do certifications really matter? Welcome to IT Certifications 101! What\u2019s the tl;dr? Certifications are critical to getting past HR for certain roles, but they won\u2019t get you the job.","Certifications are official credentials given by companies, institutions, and vendors to verify that you have demonstrated a specific knowledge or skill. They are a stamp of approval from a known brand (like Amazon) saying \u201cThis person knows their stuff.\u201d Certs are used in a lot of industries, including technology. Even within tech, there are dozens of vendors and hundreds of certs.","Many roles (including security, system administration, and networking) require certain certs to make it in the door of an interview process. This filter matters for several reasons: it helps narrow down the pool of applicants, it establishes a baseline of shared knowledge or experience across all applicants, and it expedites the process so that employers don\u2019t have to spend as much time vetting basic technical skills.","Obtaining certs in IT will provide you with a number of benefits:","At the end of the day, certifications are just pieces of paper. They represent your ability to pass a test, not to do a job. Sometimes those things are one and the same, but usually, they are very different. Certifications are like the entrance fee to get into a tournament: you still need to fight your way to the top. And when you\u2019re standing in the ring, it\u2019s better to know how to fight than to have a degree in fighting.","Additionally, not all jobs within tech care about certifications at all. For example, there is technically a Java programming certification from Oracle, but it\u2019s almost never required or considered for job applications because it tests very specific, abnormal, and academic concepts that don\u2019t apply to most real-world software development.","At Codeup, we like to think of our IT training as CertificationsPLUS, as in \u2013 you get certifications PLUS hands-on experience. Here\u2019s a quick way to think about it: Amazon Web Services has basic certifications called Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate. The official Amazon training for these certs is 1 week: 4 days of training and 1 day of exam readiness. The 1-week schedule will present to you mostly everything you need to pass the certification exam, and then it\u2019s on you to go cram and memorize to get ready. Once you pass, you\u2019ll have the cert, but you\u2019ll be a paper tiger: all bark and no bite. In other words, you\u2019ll appear knowledgeable and skillful on paper, but in reality, you won\u2019t have any experience or know-how for completing the real work.","Alternatively, Codeup spends 5 weeks on AWS, combining exam study and hands-on practice. That way, you can talk the talk and walk the walk.","If you want to learn more about IT certification and training paths, reach out to us at info@codeup.com!","","","","Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

Similar attacks are on the rise. This year, 38% more companies have experienced cyber attacks as compared to last year. Often, they involve a ransom payment in order to re-access stolen files. The amount paid by these victims has increased by 300%. In our headquarters of San Antonio, Texas, even local organizations are at risk. Recently, Judson ISD paid a $500,000 ransom.","In 2020, there were over 300,000 open roles for cybersecurity professionals in the US. To add to that, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 31% increase in Information Security roles in the upcoming years. As attacks are on the rise, the demand for cybersecurity professionals is quickly increasing. But with so many open roles, the issue isn\u2019t demand \u2013 it\u2019s supply.","Luckily, San Antonio is already a national leader in cybersecurity. We have over 16,000 employees in the field, which is the most certified cyber professionals outside of D.C.. With industry giants like USAA and Lockheed Martin in the city, we have a good footing over much of the country. Moreover, San Antonio is Military City, USA. We\u2019re home to one of the largest populations of bases, veterans, and active service members in the country. With both these backgrounds, the city is well-positioned to continue to lead our country\u2019s defense \u2013 not just traditionally, but in cyber warfare as well. ","But we still need more help. What can we do about it? Train more cybersecurity professionals. Organizations like Project Quest have supported cybersecurity training for years. But we can\u2019t rely solely on non-profit funding. There are plenty of opportunities for veterans to enter the field with VA benefits. Training programs like Codeup Cloud Academy are approved to accept GI Bill\u00ae and Vocational Rehab. This allows veterans to receive housing support while getting the cybersecurity training they need in our Cyber Cloud program.","Want to keep San Antonio safe and positioned as a leader in Cybersecurity?

For bootcamp programs, the VA uses a formula to calculate how much time to deduct from your benefits based on the program\u2019s tuition and how it compares to average college costs.","That\u2019s good news for veterans looking for a second career in the technology sector. The tech industry is fast-paced, action-oriented, and often focused on completing small goals to accomplish large ones, a familiar process for those trained by the military. With average salaries for entry-level programmers averaging around $80,000, it\u2019s a great time to learn how to code and get paid for your expertise.","You could always attend a two- or four-year college degree program in computer science and learn software development. Or you could train for these jobs by completing a specialized bootcamp program.","Coding bootcamps teach widely used programming languages and frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Python on Django, JavaScript, and PHP stacks through project-based learning. Students graduate from bootcamps with a portfolio, an online presence, interview skills, and more. Most courses even help graduates find an internship or match students with an employer network.","A bootcamp is an immersive, intense full-time learning environment. Students should prepare to scale back outside activities and give up full-time employment for the program\u2019s course. Coding bootcamps vary in length from six to 28 weeks, although the average time is about 14 weeks long. Military service members transitioning from active duty to veteran status can often leverage terminal leave to attend a coding bootcamp.","If you\u2019re still wondering whether to choose a college program or a tech career accelerator, here are some points to consider:","A tech workforce development program usually translates into extensive, hands-on instruction in say, learning how to write code in less time than it takes to complete a two- or four-year degree program. Some bootcamps may be offered through established state or private universities, while some private providers offer training programs.","Texas-based Codeup offers accelerated programs in San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, and Houston to help you launch your tech career. No previous experience is needed to participate in any of Codeup\u2019s accelerator programs, all of which are GI Bill\u00ae eligible.","Apply to Codeup\u2019s full-stack web development to learn how to create an app or website from start to finish using today\u2019s coding languages in just 20 weeks.Apply to Codeup\u2019s systems engineering bootcamp if you\u2019re up for problem-solving in information technology in this 13-week accelerator.Apply to Codeup\u2019s data science bootcamp if you\u2019d like to be a data scientist and learn how to apply machine learning models to make predictions and turn your insights into actionable recommendations over the course of 20 weeks.","You\u2019ll also get professional job application counseling and support as an ongoing part of our curriculum, which continues even after graduation. Veterans and their dependents may also apply for a Codeup scholarship to offset the amount of VA benefits used for tuition.","Codeup\u2019s job guarantee means you\u2019ll get hired for a tech job you\u2019ve trained for within six months of graduating or receive a refund of 100% of your tuition.","For more information on Codeup\u2019s GI Bill\u00ae eligible bootcamp programs, reach out to one of our admissions specialists for more details or call us at 210-802-7289.","Contributing Author Iris Gonzalez.","","","","Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

I would go from home to home working with children anywhere from 1 year old to 18 years old. After 5 years of the profession, my body was getting tired driving around all the time and I felt overworked. The work was satisfying and I do miss working with the kiddos, but I just felt drained. I knew it was time to find a different field, so I started thinking about what else I was good at.","Then one day as I was on my way to a patient\u2019s home, I found a Codeup billboard near Splashtown that said \u201cdrive to a job you love\u201d and I took it as a sign. I thought, \u201cI want to drive to a job I love!\u201d I had also heard nothing but good things about Codeup from a friend that went the Web Development route. She answered my questions and helped me through the whole process.","At first, I was a little worried about tuition payment, but once I got started in the application process, they held Zoom meetings where they would talk about all the funding options. They made it really easy and addressed all of my concerns. I realized I didn\u2019t have to be scared about the financial aspect. I applied to a couple of grants and was able to get about a third of my tuition covered through the Train for Jobs SA grant from Workforce Solutions Alamo. That really helped me. I also received a few different scholarships from Codeup. The rest of it was a loan from Meritize.","It was difficult leaving something I was comfortable and familiar with to start something new with no data science background, but I have always enjoyed all things tech. Once we got into the pre-assessment work and then the prework leading up to class, it showed me, \u201cokay this IS what I wanted to be doing.\u201d I really enjoyed it, thought it was fun, and realized this was for me.","Overall, I really enjoyed the program. We were in Zoom the whole time because of the pandemic, but they made it slow, nice, and easy. The instructors are absolutely wonderful. Every single instructor helped me at one point or another, teaching things from ground zero and explaining everything really nicely in a way I can understand. One thing I value the most about the instructors is that, not only do they go over all the necessary skills needed in a data-related career, but they teach us how to learn the skills as well. They didn\u2019t just give us the work and tell us exactly how to do it. They provide instruction, hands-on exercises\/projects, and answers to all questions, but most importantly, they walk us through how to work with the data and obtain the answers on our own. This is extremely valuable as I believe it is the key to success in this field.","Now after graduating from Codeup, I\u2019m a Business Intelligence Analyst at Liquid Web. I\u2019ve been here almost three months now and I\u2019m contributing to so many projects. I really feel like a true member of the team. I can figure things out for myself and my bosses are telling me how well I\u2019m doing and how far I\u2019ve come since working here. I didn\u2019t have to ask for much help or training, because Codeup prepared me well and taught me how to learn when I run into skills they don\u2019t teach. It\u2019s been really good.","I\u2019m so glad I made this change. It was scary to take that leap of faith, but ultimately, I\u2019m really glad I did. I love my job and I love what I\u2019m doing. If anyone is looking to make a career change and struggling to find their best fit, I recommend looking into Codeup and going through their process. I\u2019m extremely happy where I am right now and wouldn\u2019t change a thing.","","","","Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

For starters, we\u2019re licensed and regulated by the Texas Workforce Commission. We\u2019re also approved by the SAA Texas Veterans Commission to accept VA Benefits, and audited by the Council for Integrity in Results Reporting. This already gives us a premier status and a trusted brand name. But there\u2019s one missing piece that would take us to the next level: an accrediting body. Now, we\u2019re well on our way there! We are proud to announce that, effective May 2021,  Codeup is a Candidate for Accreditation by The Middle States Association Commission on Secondary Schools (MSA-CSS), which is located at 3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (Phone: 267-284-5000).","Accrediting bodies provide guidance and best practices for institutions like Codeup, and verify the quality of our education. The MSA-CSS in particular is recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. Getting accredited by them would allow us to establish eligibility to participate in federal Title IV student loan programs for adult students. This could be huge for our applicants, as it would significantly expand access to financial aid and allow even more people to change their lives by launching a tech career at Codeup. We would also be the first and only\u00a0career accelerator with MSA-CSS\u00a0accreditation in Texas. One article even states that coding bootcamps, in general, are not accredited.","Currently, we are a candidate for accreditation, and not yet accredited. (Establishing candidacy is in itself a big feat, and a little bird told us our application was in the top 1% over at least the last 15 years!) Now that we\u2019re candidates, we are actively working with the MSA-CSS to meet or exceed the requirements for accreditation. This process usually takes 18-24 months. Once approved, it would be an additional 12-18 months for Title IV acceptance, which is what would enable students to receive federal loans.","As the Premier Career Accelerator in Texas, we are thrilled about this news. Adding this layer of compliance and quality assurance will significantly improve the quality of education we provide and the way that we provide it. It will help us abide by our core values of Delivering Excellence, Acting with Integrity, Cultivating Inclusive Growth, and Being Helpful. It will help us live out our mission of empowering life change on a bigger and better scale, so that we can continue to be the #1 option for Texans looking to launch a career in tech!","Not familiar with Codeup?

We\u2019ve gone from a humble beginning in the middle of a coworking space called Geekdom, to now having three floors of our own in our favorite downtown building.","Codeup has a campus in Dallas, classrooms in the Rackspace Castle in San Antonio, and offices in Houston and Austin. But Downtown San Antonio is where we were born and raised, and where we\u2019ve planted our flag for our headquarters. While other Texas cities are becoming known for tech, San Antonio never has been. This is the city where we can make the biggest impact on the local tech scene. We\u2019re supplying companies with the in-demand tech talent that has been missing locally while changing lives by launching San Antonians into these tech careers.\u00a0","The SA Tech District is growing downtown and the historic Vogue building is in the heart of it all! We\u2019ve been part of that action for 7 years and in the Vogue Building for 6 of them. Changing careers is a lot of work, both on our staff and students. We want to have fun while doing it! We need an upbeat atmosphere where we can stay plugged into San Antonio and engaged in the tech scene. Steps away from the Majestic Theater, the Riverwalk, and our old home at Geekdom, our students and staff have a location to be excited about. ","During the pandemic, our staff doubled in size and we\u2019ve outgrown our two floors. As we invite our staff back to working in-office, they need to be able to fit. By expanding into the second floor, our staff will have breathing room and ample space for social distancing. Our classrooms will stay on the 6th floor, where students get the best views of downtown. ","If you want to get plugged into the San Antonio tech scene, you\u2019ve got options with Codeup! Launch a career in tech as a web developer, data scientist, system administrator, or cyber cloud specialist. Work in the office with us by joining our staff. Or, hire our grads. Hope to see you at the Vogue someday!","","","","Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let\u2019s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.","We\u2019re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We\u2019re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.","In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren\u2019t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.","To cultivate inclusive growth, we don\u2019t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.","Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you\u2019re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now. Then, apply for our Pride Scholarship.","","","","Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.
